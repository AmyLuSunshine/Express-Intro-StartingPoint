# ðŸš‚ Intro Express

## Getting Started

This project uses Express.js to serve up an API server. You should start by forking or cloning this repo, and then adding your teammates as collaborators.

Then, follow the same steps we've been following:

```
npm install
npm run start-dev
```

This project runs in the Node.js runtime environment. We're not using Webpack here, but we are using a tool called nodemon, which re-runs our app whenever we save a file. You should see a message in the terminal telling you that the server is running on port 8080.

When an error occurs on the backend (Express), you'll see a message in the terminal. When an error occurs on the frontend (React), you'll see that error in the browser.
